# Data 

```rhai

git::restore("README.md");

// This is where we have the main Rust code for this simple crate
let main_code = file::load("./src/json/json_value_ext.rs");

// This will remove the function implementation and possible tests { ... }
// Save money and avoid LLM noise
let main_code = rust::prune_to_declarations(main_code.content);

let readme_md = file::load("README.md");

return #{
    main_code: main_code,
    readme_md: readme_md
}

```


# Instruction

Here is the main code of this library (function bodies were removed for brevity)

```rust
{{data.main_code}}
```

Here is the README.md

```md
{{data.readme_md.content}}
```

- Can you provide a new README that includes all of the new features while following the current README format?

- Provide the README content exactly as is, without a preface and without wrapping it in a markdown code block.

# Output 

```rhai

file::save("README.md", ai_output);

```
